## Self Service LDAP Password

### Background
This is an open source PHP web application that will allow an LDAP user to update their own password or SSH public key

### Technology
- running Ubuntu 20.04 or newer
- OpenLDAP as the LDAP software
- Nginx, web server to host the Self Service web interface

### Installation
- install the required packages
```
apt install -y php-fpm php-gd smarty3
```

- download the sources
  The source can be found here [ Self Service Password](https://ltb-project.org/download.html)

- extra the source under /usr/share and then rename to /usr/share/self-service-password

- edit the configuration file  i/usr/share/self-service-password/conf/config.inc.php 
  you can find the one I use [here](https://github.com/my10c/ldap-tool-go/blob/main/docs/selfService/example-config.inc.php) (minus secrets üòà)

- set permission correct with 
```
cd  /usr/share/self-service-password
find . -type d | xargs chmod 0755
find . -type f | xargs chmod 0644
chown root:www-data conf/config.inc.php
chmod 0440 conf/config.inc.php
```

- copy the images you would like under the images directory
```
cp image image /usr/share/self-service-password/htdocs/images
chmod -444 /usr/share/self-service-password/htdocs/images/*
chown root:root /usr/share/self-service-password/htdocs/images/*
```

- Install the Web server
  This should be done if nginx will be replacing the apache web server,
  setup php-fpm and nginx to serve the self service application is beyond this scope
  you can find and example of my nginx configuration [here](https://github.com/my10c/ldap-tool-go/blob/main/docs/selfService/example-nginx-self-service.conf)
  you can find and example of my ssl configuration [here](https://github.com/my10c/ldap-tool-go/blob/main/docs/selfService/example-nginx-ssl.conf)
```
apt remove apache2 apache2-bin apache2-data
apt install nginx
```

Congraculation you should be all set now : ü¶Ñüëè
